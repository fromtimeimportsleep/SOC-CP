# SOC-CP
I configured VS Code in WSL in my system. 
I started by reading the first few chapters of the competitive programming handbook, and learnt more about time complexity.
I read about macros and other ways to shorten my code in CP, and have created my own template.
I read more about sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. I also understood the proof as to why no comparison based sorting algorithm can be faster than O(nlogn) in time complexity.
I tried working with various data structures in C++ like stack, queue, deque, vector and set.
I read more about binary search, and got comfortable in implementing it in 2 different methods. I realized that many questions can be done by binary search, even if it doesn't seem related in first glance.
I read about BSTs and how to use them to solve questions in shorter time complexity. (Mainly O(nlogn))
I also tried questions which can be solved using Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.
