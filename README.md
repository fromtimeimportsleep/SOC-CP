# SOC-CP  

**Week 1**  
We began by configuring our coding environment. We learned how to set up Visual Studio Code and MinGW. We explored basic number theory, bitwise operators, and time complexity. The real excitement began when we delved into the essential data structures in C++ STL, such as stacks, queues, priority queues, and more.  

**Week 2**  
We took a deep dive into sorting and searching algorithms. We studied selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and heap sort. We also learned about the divide and conquer techniques, which break down complex problems into smaller manageable subproblems.  

**Week 3**  
We explored greedy programming, an algorithmic strategy that involves making locally optimal choices to reach a globally optimal solution. We learned how to choose the best option at each stage while solving optimization problems. We also introduced dynamic programming, a smart way to iteratively solve problems with exponential time complexity and reduce it to linear time.  

**Week 4**  
The fourth week was all about Binary Search Trees (BST) and Graphs. In BST, we studied the definition, properties, traversal, insertion, and deletion. We also explored advanced concepts like Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees for maintaining balance in the tree.  
For Graphs, we covered terminology, different types of graphs, ways to represent graphs in code, and graph traversals like DFS and BFS. We saw how they are useful in solving various problems like connected components, 2-Edge connectivity, and Bipartite checking.  

**Week 5**  
We went deeper into algorithms for shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and strong connectivity in directed graphs. These algorithms build upon the concepts we learned in the previous weeks and offer powerful tools for problem-solving in competitive programming.
